# Privacy Policy for YouTube Video Organizer Chrome Extension

**Last Updated:** July 28, 2025

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the YouTube Video Organizer Chrome Extension ("Extension") handles your information when you use our browser extension. This policy applies to all users of the Extension.

## Information We Collect

**We do not collect any data from you.** The YouTube Video Organizer Chrome Extension operates entirely locally on your device and does not transmit, store, or collect any information on external servers.

### What Happens Locally

When you use the Extension, all data is processed and stored locally on your device. Any data that belongs to YouTube is stored and processed in accordance with YouTube's privacy guidelines.

## How We Use Your Information

**We do not use your information in any way.** Since we do not collect or transmit any data, there is no information for us to use.

### Chrome Web Store Analytics
The Chrome Web Store may provide us with basic, anonymous usage statistics such as install counts, active users, and geographic distribution. This data is provided by Google and does not include any personal information or individual user data.

## Data Storage and Security

- **IndexedDB**: All your video data is stored locally in your browser using IndexedDB
- **Your Device Only**: Your data remains on your device and is protected by your browser's built-in security measures

### Future Cloud Syncing (If Implemented)
If cloud syncing functionality is ever added to the Extension in the future:
- **Default Setting**: Cloud syncing will be **deactivated by default**
- **Opt-In Only**: Users must explicitly enable cloud syncing if they choose to use it
- **Clear Notification**: Users will be clearly notified about any changes to data handling practices
- **Updated Policy**: This privacy policy will be updated to reflect any new data collection practices

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

### No Data to Share
Since we do not collect, store, or transmit any of your data, there is no information to share with anyone. Your data remains entirely on your device and is never accessible to us or any third parties.

### User-Created Data Privacy
Any data you create using the Extension (such as custom tags, personal notes, or organization preferences) is stored locally on your device and is not shared with:
- **YouTube**: We do not send your tags, notes, or other similar data back to YouTube
- **Extension Owner**: We have no access to your user-created content
- **Third Parties**: Your custom data is never transmitted to any external services

For example, if you tag a video using the Extension's tagging feature, only you will have access to that tag data. YouTube cannot see your tags, and we cannot access them either.

### YouTube Data
Data belonging to YouTube and your YouTube account (e.g., playlists) is property of YouTube and known to them and you but not us.

If you enable YouTube Integration > Show Saved Video Indicators, YouTube may be able to detect your extension use and read the ids of the videos you have saved.

## Permissions Used And Why

### Host Permissions

YouTube Video Organizer requires access to YouTube pages to inject "Save" buttons and "Saved/Archived" indicators directly into YouTube's interface.

The extension extracts video metadata (title, channel, duration, thumbnail) from YouTube pages to create organized video records.

These permissions are limited exclusively to YouTube domains and are used solely for reading publicly available video information.

## Your Rights and Choices

### Data Control
You have complete control over your data:
- **Backup**: You can create and restore backups of your data
- **Delete Data**: You can delete individual videos or clear all data
- **Uninstall**: Removing the Extension deletes all stored data

## Data Retention

### IndexedDB Storage Duration
- **Active Use**: Your data is retained as long as you use the Extension
- **Extension Removal**: All data is permanently deleted when you uninstall the Extension
- **Browser Data Clearing**: Your data may be deleted if you clear browser data

## International Users

The Extension is designed to work with YouTube content globally. Your data is stored locally on your device and is subject to the laws of your jurisdiction.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.
